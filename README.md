# Abstract

The Fediverse is emerging as a decentralized, non-commercial alternative to traditional social media, giving users more control and promoting community engagement. Built on open-source platforms and interconnected via the ActivityPub protocol, this architecture allows for transparency, user autonomy, and ethical governance among thousands of independent instances.

However, the growing presence of automated social bot accounts is affecting conversations and information dissemination.

In response, this paper presents Mastoanalyzer, a versatile tool designed to analyze user behavior and detect automation on Mastodon, one of the Fediverse's prominent platforms. This tool not only addresses the challenges posed by the increasing presence of bots but also helps in understanding human behavior and digital dynamics in decentralized contexts. It uses REST APIs, MySQL databases, and JSON formatting, supporting scalable data collection and long-term analysis. Its modular design allows for seamless adaptation to varied research needs and integration of machine learning for real-time bot detection.

What distinguishes Mastoanalyzer is not only its technical power but also its ethical commitment. It presents itself as an ally for anyone who wants to understand and contribute to the evolution of decentralized social networks, fostering greater awareness about the impact of automation and the quality of online interaction. By promoting transparent analysis, this tool is a valuable resource for better understanding the dynamics of digital communities while supporting responsible data management and respecting the autonomy of federated platforms such as Mastodon.
